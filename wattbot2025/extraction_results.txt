  "two.pdf": " The text provides data on the carbon emission reduction achieved by implementing Flexible Start (FS) and Pause and Resume (P&R) optimizations for machine learning models on cloud services. These optimizations are methods to reduce energy consumption during periods of idle or low-load operations.\n\nThe data is presented in tables, each table shows the gain in percentage for FS and P&R optimizations when allowing for different increments in job duration (6h, 12h, 18h, 75%, 100%). The last row of each table provides the average number of pauses per hour performed by the P&R optimization.\n\nFor example, for a Dense model with a length of 201 during a 6h increase in job duration:\n- Flexible Start (FS) optimization achieves a reduction of 10.1% in carbon emissions.\n- Pause and Resume (P&R) optimization achieves a reduction of 13.8% in carbon emissions.\n- On average, the P&R optimization performs 0.33 pauses per hour.\n\nThese optimizations are important for reducing the environmental impact of machine learning on cloud services by minimizing energy consumption during periods of low usage.",
